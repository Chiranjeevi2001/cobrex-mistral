# Finetuning Mistral 7b instruct model for COBREX
This work deals with the finetuning of the popular LLM `Mistral-7b` on business rules JSON database which was manually created through few-shot prompting with `Gemini Pro`. We aim to automate the process of extracting Business rules from legacy COBOL code and using it to better understand the business logic embedded within the code. With this, a way to streamline modernization tasks can be formed which revolves around the idea of extracting and understanding the business rules embedded within legacy code base.
